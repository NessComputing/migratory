Managing databases. 


Acknowledgements
----------------

This product owes a debt of gratitude to the Flyway project at
http://http://code.google.com/p/flyway/. While looking through various
ways to replace our homebrewed tool for database migrations, this was
the most promising one that got close to what we wanted (but did not
include the independent personality management that we require). A lot
of the structure and even some of the unit tests are a testament to
this. However, we vastly changed the scope and the functionality to
suit our needs.


Bugs

There should be actual documentation.
